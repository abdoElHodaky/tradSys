# High-Frequency Trading Platform Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the high-frequency trading platform.

## Overview

The platform is designed for high-performance trading with low-latency communication using WebSockets and PeerJS. It follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns and optimized data flow.

## Core Components

### 1. WebSocket Server

The platform provides two WebSocket server implementations:

#### Legacy WebSocket Server
- Simple JSON-based messaging
- Basic connection management
- Channel-based subscriptions

#### Enhanced WebSocket Server
- Binary message format using Protocol Buffers
- Efficient connection pooling
- Advanced subscription management
- Compression support
- Heartbeat mechanism
- Performance metrics

### 2. PeerJS Server

The PeerJS server enables peer-to-peer communication between clients:

- WebRTC signaling server
- Connection negotiation
- Peer discovery
- Heartbeat mechanism
- Connection cleanup

### 3. Market Data Service

- Real-time market data processing
- Exchange-specific feed handlers
- Data normalization
- Order book management
- Market data distribution

### 4. Order Management System

- Order creation and management
- Smart order routing
- Order execution
- Order status tracking
- Trade reporting

### 5. Risk Management System

- Pre-trade risk checks
- Position limits
- Circuit breakers
- Compliance monitoring
- Audit trail

## Data Flow

1. **Market Data Flow**:
   - Exchange feeds → Market Data Service → WebSocket Server → Clients
   - Exchange feeds → Market Data Service → PeerJS Server → Peer Clients

2. **Order Flow**:
   - Client → WebSocket/PeerJS → Order Management System → Risk Management System → Exchange
   - Exchange → Order Management System → WebSocket/PeerJS → Client

3. **Risk Management Flow**:
   - Order → Risk Management System → Approval/Rejection
   - Market Data → Risk Management System → Circuit Breaker Triggers

## Communication Protocols

### WebSocket Communication

The platform uses two types of WebSocket communication:

1. **JSON-based (Legacy)**:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "marketData",
     "channel": "marketData",
     "symbol": "BTC-USD",
     "data": {
       "price": 50000,
       "volume": 1.5
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Binary Protocol Buffers (Enhanced)**:
   - Efficient binary serialization
   - Strongly typed messages
   - Reduced bandwidth usage
   - Lower latency

### PeerJS Communication

PeerJS enables direct peer-to-peer communication:

1. **Signaling**:
   - WebSocket-based signaling server
   - Connection negotiation
   - Peer discovery

2. **Data Channels**:
   - Direct WebRTC data channels
   - Low-latency communication
   - Binary message support

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Connection Management
- Connection pooling
- Efficient subscription tracking
- Lazy initialization

### 2. Message Serialization
- Protocol Buffers for binary serialization
- Message compression
- Batch processing

### 3. Memory Management
- Object pooling
- Reduced garbage collection
- Efficient data structures

### 4. Network Optimization
- WebSocket compression
- Binary message format
- Connection keep-alive

## Deployment Architecture

The platform can be deployed in various configurations:

### 1. Single Server
- All components on a single server
- Suitable for development and testing

### 2. Distributed
- Market data service on dedicated servers
- Order management on dedicated servers
- WebSocket servers behind load balancer
- Database with read replicas

### 3. Cloud-Native
- Containerized microservices
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Multi-region deployment

## Security Considerations

- TLS encryption for all connections
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Audit logging

## Monitoring and Observability

- Real-time metrics collection
- Latency tracking
- Error monitoring
- Health checks
- Alerting system

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Anomaly detection
   - Predictive analytics
   - Trading strategy optimization

2. **Advanced Order Types**:
   - TWAP/VWAP algorithms
   - Iceberg orders
   - Conditional orders

3. **Enhanced P2P Features**:
   - Distributed order book
   - P2P trading
   - Decentralized market data distribution
