# TradSys Architecture

## Overview

TradSys is a high-performance trading system built with a modular architecture using Go and the fx dependency injection framework. The system is designed to be scalable, resilient, and maintainable, with a focus on performance and reliability.

## Core Components

### 1. Order Matching Engine

The order matching engine is responsible for matching buy and sell orders. It implements a price-time priority algorithm and supports various order types:

- Market orders
- Limit orders
- Stop-limit orders
- Stop-market orders

The engine maintains an order book for each trading symbol and provides methods for placing, canceling, and querying orders.

### 2. Market Data Handler

The market data handler processes real-time market data from various sources. It supports different types of market data:

- Order book updates
- Trade executions
- Ticker updates
- OHLCV candles

The handler also provides functionality for aggregating market data into different timeframes and calculating technical indicators.

### 3. Strategy Framework

The strategy framework allows for the implementation of trading strategies. It provides interfaces and base classes for creating strategies, as well as utilities for backtesting and optimization.

Strategies can subscribe to market data, place orders, and track their performance metrics.

### 4. Risk Management System

The risk management system enforces risk limits and monitors exposures. It includes:

- Position limit management
- Exposure tracking
- Pre-trade and post-trade risk validation
- Risk reporting

The system uses middleware to integrate with the order flow and can generate alerts when risk limits are exceeded.

### 5. Event Sourcing and CQRS

The system uses event sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) patterns for maintaining state and handling commands and queries. This provides:

- Audit trail of all system actions
- Ability to replay events for debugging
- Separation of read and write models for better performance

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Dependency Injection with fx

TradSys uses Uber's fx framework for dependency injection, which provides:

- Modular component registration
- Lifecycle management
- Dependency graph construction
- Testability through easy mocking

### 2. Worker Pool Pattern

The worker pool pattern is used for concurrent task execution:

- Task submission and execution
- Pool management
- Performance metrics
- Error handling

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern

The circuit breaker pattern is used for resilience:

- Failure detection
- Circuit state management (closed, open, half-open)
- Fallback handling
- Metrics collection

### 4. Middleware Pattern

The middleware pattern is used for cross-cutting concerns:

- Request/response logging
- Authentication and authorization
- Risk validation
- Circuit breaking

## Dependency Graph

## Communication Flow

1. Market data flows from external sources into the market data handler
2. The market data handler processes and aggregates the data
3. Strategies subscribe to market data and generate trading signals
4. Trading signals are converted to orders
5. Orders pass through risk validation middleware
6. Valid orders are sent to the order matching engine
7. The order matching engine matches orders and generates trades
8. Trade notifications are sent back to strategies and risk management
9. Risk management monitors positions and exposures

## Performance Considerations

- The system uses lock-free data structures where possible
- Critical paths are optimized for low latency
- Object pooling is used to reduce garbage collection pressure
- Worker pools are used for concurrent processing
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures

## Resilience Patterns

- Circuit breakers protect against external service failures
- Retry mechanisms handle transient failures
- Fallback strategies provide degraded service when primary methods fail
- Bulkhead pattern isolates failures to prevent system-wide impact
- Timeout patterns prevent resource exhaustion

## Monitoring and Metrics

The system collects various metrics:

- Order execution latency
- Matching engine throughput
- Strategy performance metrics
- Risk exposure metrics
- System health metrics

These metrics can be exported to monitoring systems for visualization and alerting.

## Configuration

The system is configured through a combination of:

- Configuration files
- Environment variables
- Command-line flags
- Dynamic configuration through API

## Deployment

The system can be deployed as:

- A single binary for simple deployments
- Multiple services for scalability
- Containerized for cloud deployments

## Future Enhancements

- Distributed order matching
- Machine learning integration
- Advanced risk models
- Multi-asset support
- Regulatory reporting
