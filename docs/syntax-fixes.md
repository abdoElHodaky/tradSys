# Syntax Fixes and Risk Management Enhancements

This document outlines the syntax fixes and risk management enhancements implemented in the high-frequency trading platform.

## Order Model Enhancements

### 1. Added Risk Management Fields

The `Order` struct in `internal/db/models/order.go` has been enhanced with the following fields:

```go
// Order represents an order in the system
type Order struct {
    // ... existing fields
    StopLoss   float64     `gorm:"default:0"` // Stop loss price level
    TakeProfit float64     `gorm:"default:0"` // Take profit price level
    Strategy   string      `gorm:"index"`     // Strategy that generated this order
    Timestamp  time.Time   `gorm:"index"`     // Time when the order was created by the strategy
    // ... existing fields
}
```

These fields enable:
- **Stop Loss**: Automatic order execution when price reaches a specified loss threshold
- **Take Profit**: Automatic order execution when price reaches a specified profit threshold
- **Strategy Tracking**: Tracking which strategy generated each order
- **Timestamp**: Recording when the strategy created the order

### 2. Fixed Field Name Mismatches

Fixed field name mismatches in strategy code:
- Changed `OrderType` to `Type` to match the Order struct
- Changed string literals to enum constants:
  - `"buy"` → `models.OrderSideBuy`
  - `"sell"` → `models.OrderSideSell`
  - `"market"` → `models.OrderTypeMarket`
  - `"limit"` → `models.OrderTypeLimit`

## Protocol Buffer Updates

Updated the Protocol Buffer definitions in `proto/orders/orders.proto` to include the new fields:

```protobuf
message Order {
    // ... existing fields
    double stop_loss = 14;
    double take_profit = 15;
    string strategy = 16;
}

message OrderRequest {
    // ... existing fields
    double stop_loss = 8;
    double take_profit = 9;
    string strategy = 10;
}
```

## Database Migration

Created a database migration in `internal/db/migrations/add_risk_management_fields.go` to:
- Add `stop_loss`, `take_profit`, `strategy`, and `timestamp` columns to the orders table
- Create indexes on `strategy` and `timestamp` columns for improved query performance
- Ensure idempotent migration with existence checks

## Order Service Updates

Updated the order service in `internal/orders/service.go` to handle the new fields:
- Added mapping for the new fields when converting between protobuf and database models
- Ensured proper initialization of the new fields

## Benefits

These enhancements provide several benefits:
1. **Improved Risk Management**: Automatic stop loss and take profit execution
2. **Better Strategy Analysis**: Tracking which strategies generated which orders
3. **Enhanced Performance Monitoring**: Ability to analyze strategy performance over time
4. **Consistent Code**: Fixed syntax issues and field name mismatches
5. **Database Optimization**: Added indexes for improved query performance
