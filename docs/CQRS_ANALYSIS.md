# CQRS Analysis for TradSys

## Overview

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that separates read and write operations into different models. This analysis evaluates the benefits and implementation strategy for TradSys.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Current State
- **Unified Models**: Single domain models used for both reads and writes
- **Shared Database**: Same database tables for commands and queries
- **Service Layer**: Services handle both command and query operations
- **Real-time Requirements**: Trading system needs sub-millisecond latency

### Pain Points Identified
1. **Read/Write Conflicts**: Complex queries impact write performance
2. **Scaling Challenges**: Read-heavy operations (market data, order history) vs write-heavy (order processing)
3. **Model Complexity**: Single models trying to serve multiple use cases
4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Database contention between reads and writes

## CQRS Benefits for Trading Systems

### 1. Performance Optimization
- **Separate Scaling**: Scale read and write sides independently
- **Optimized Data Models**: Read models optimized for queries, write models for transactions
- **Reduced Contention**: Eliminate read/write database locks
- **Caching Strategy**: Aggressive caching on read side without affecting writes

### 2. Consistency Models
- **Eventual Consistency**: Acceptable for most trading queries (order history, statistics)
- **Strong Consistency**: Maintained for critical operations (order matching, balances)
- **Read Replicas**: Multiple read replicas for different query patterns

### 3. Scalability
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale read replicas based on query load
- **Write Optimization**: Optimize write side for high-throughput order processing
- **Geographic Distribution**: Read replicas closer to users

## CQRS Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Command Side (Write Model)

#### Command Handlers
```go
type OrderCommandHandler struct {
    repository interfaces.OrderRepository
    eventStore interfaces.EventStore
    validator  interfaces.OrderValidator
}

type CreateOrderCommand struct {
    UserID      string
    Symbol      string
    Side        types.OrderSide
    Type        types.OrderType
    Price       float64
    Quantity    float64
    TimeInForce types.TimeInForce
}

func (h *OrderCommandHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, cmd *CreateOrderCommand) (*OrderCreatedEvent, error) {
    // Validate command
    // Create domain object
    // Persist to write store
    // Publish event
}
```

#### Event Store
```go
type Event struct {
    ID          string
    AggregateID string
    Type        string
    Data        []byte
    Version     int
    Timestamp   time.Time
}

type EventStore interface {
    SaveEvents(ctx context.Context, aggregateID string, events []Event, expectedVersion int) error
    GetEvents(ctx context.Context, aggregateID string, fromVersion int) ([]Event, error)
}
```

### Phase 2: Query Side (Read Model)

#### Read Models
```go
// Optimized for order listing
type OrderReadModel struct {
    ID          string
    UserID      string
    Symbol      string
    Side        string
    Status      string
    Price       float64
    Quantity    float64
    CreatedAt   time.Time
    // Denormalized fields for fast queries
    UserName    string
    SymbolName  string
}

// Optimized for trading statistics
type TradingStatsReadModel struct {
    UserID          string
    Symbol          string
    TotalOrders     int
    TotalVolume     float64
    AveragePrice    float64
    LastTradeTime   time.Time
    // Pre-calculated aggregations
}
```

#### Query Handlers
```go
type OrderQueryHandler struct {
    readStore interfaces.ReadStore
    cache     interfaces.Cache
}

type GetOrdersQuery struct {
    UserID string
    Symbol string
    Status string
    Limit  int
    Offset int
}

func (h *OrderQueryHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, query *GetOrdersQuery) ([]*OrderReadModel, error) {
    // Check cache first
    // Query optimized read store
    // Return denormalized data
}
```

### Phase 3: Event Sourcing Integration

#### Event Sourcing Benefits
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every state change is recorded
- **Temporal Queries**: Query system state at any point in time
- **Replay Capability**: Rebuild read models from events
- **Debugging**: Full history for troubleshooting

#### Event Types
```go
type OrderCreatedEvent struct {
    OrderID     string
    UserID      string
    Symbol      string
    Side        types.OrderSide
    Price       float64
    Quantity    float64
    Timestamp   time.Time
}

type OrderMatchedEvent struct {
    OrderID       string
    MatchedWith   string
    Price         float64
    Quantity      float64
    RemainingQty  float64
    Timestamp     time.Time
}

type OrderCancelledEvent struct {
    OrderID     string
    Reason      string
    Timestamp   time.Time
}
```

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Command Side Architecture

```
Client Request → Command Handler → Domain Model → Event Store → Event Bus
                      ↓
                 Write Database
```

**Components:**
- **Command Bus**: Routes commands to appropriate handlers
- **Command Handlers**: Process business logic and generate events
- **Domain Models**: Rich business objects with behavior
- **Event Store**: Persistent event log
- **Write Database**: Current state for immediate consistency needs

### 2. Query Side Architecture

```
Event Bus → Event Handlers → Read Model Updaters → Read Database → Query Handlers → Client Response
```

**Components:**
- **Event Handlers**: Process events and update read models
- **Read Model Updaters**: Transform events into optimized read models
- **Read Database**: Denormalized, query-optimized storage
- **Query Handlers**: Serve read requests
- **Cache Layer**: Redis/Memcached for hot data

### 3. Event Processing Pipeline

```
Event Store → Event Processor → Read Model Projections → Materialized Views
```

**Features:**
- **Event Replay**: Rebuild read models from scratch
- **Snapshots**: Periodic snapshots for performance
- **Projections**: Multiple read models from same events
- **Sagas**: Long-running business processes

## Technology Stack Recommendations
