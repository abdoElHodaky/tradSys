# Phase 3.3: Enhanced Security, Validation, and User Management

This phase focuses on enhancing the security, adding input validation, implementing user management, and adding WebSocket authentication for the high-frequency trading platform.

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Rate Limiting

Implemented rate limiting to protect against DoS attacks:
- `internal/api/middleware/security.go`: Rate limiting middleware
- Configurable rate limits (default: 100 requests per minute)
- IP-based rate limiting with memory store

### 2. Security Headers

Added security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy
- Strict-Transport-Security

### 3. CORS Configuration

Implemented CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to control access to the API:
- Configurable CORS headers
- Proper handling of preflight requests

### 4. Request Logging and Panic Recovery

Added request logging and panic recovery middleware:
- Detailed request logging with latency information
- Panic recovery to prevent application crashes
- Structured logging with zap

## Input Validation

### 1. Validation Framework

Created a comprehensive validation framework:
- `internal/validation/validator.go`: Validation utilities
- Custom validation rules for trading-specific data
- User-friendly error messages

### 2. Custom Validators

Implemented custom validators for trading-specific data:
- Password validator (requires uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
- Symbol validator (validates trading symbols in the format BASE/QUOTE)
- Amount validator (validates positive amounts)
- Price validator (validates positive prices)

## User Management

### 1. User Model

Implemented a user model with role-based access control:
- `internal/db/models/user.go`: User model with roles and permissions
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based permission system

### 2. User Repository

Created a user repository for database operations:
- `internal/db/repositories/user_repository.go`: CRUD operations for users
- Efficient database queries with proper error handling
- Pagination support for listing users

### 3. User Service

Implemented a user service for business logic:
- `internal/user/service.go`: User registration, login, and management
- Password validation and secure storage
- JWT token generation for authentication

### 4. User API

Created API endpoints for user management:
- `internal/api/handlers/user.go`: User API handlers
- Registration, login, profile management
- Role-based access control for admin operations

## WebSocket Authentication

### 1. Authenticated WebSocket Connections

Implemented authentication for WebSocket connections:
- `internal/ws/auth.go`: WebSocket authentication utilities
- Token-based authentication with JWT
- Role-based authorization for WebSocket operations

### 2. Authenticated WebSocket Server

Created an authenticated WebSocket server:
- `internal/ws/authenticated_server.go`: WebSocket server with authentication
- Secure message handling with user context
- Role-based broadcasting and message filtering

## Next Steps

1. Implement comprehensive testing for all components
2. Add integration tests for the entire system
3. Implement user management UI
4. Enhance monitoring and alerting for security events
5. Implement WebSocket message validation
