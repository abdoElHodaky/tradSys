# Dynamic Loading Implementation Plan - Phase 2: Synchronization Improvements

This document outlines the implementation details for Phase 2 of the dynamic loading improvements, focusing on synchronization enhancements.

## 1. Fine-grained Locking Strategy

### 1.1 Lock Hierarchy

We've replaced the global mutex with specialized locks for different operations:

- `configMu` (RWMutex): For configuration changes
- `pluginMu` (RWMutex): For plugin operations
- `scannerMu` (Mutex): For scanner operations
- `dirsMu` (RWMutex): For directory operations

This separation allows for better concurrency by minimizing lock contention between unrelated operations.

### 1.2 Lock Acquisition Order

To prevent deadlocks, we've established a consistent lock acquisition order:

1. `configMu`
2. `scannerMu`
3. `pluginMu`
4. `dirsMu`

When multiple locks are needed, they must be acquired in this order to prevent circular wait conditions.

## 2. Deadlock Detection

### 2.1 Timeout-based Detection

We've implemented a timeout-based deadlock detection mechanism:

- Each lock acquisition attempt has a configurable timeout
- If a lock cannot be acquired within the timeout, a potential deadlock is logged
- Operations can gracefully degrade or abort when deadlocks are detected

### 2.2 Lock Acquisition Helpers

Two helper methods have been added to standardize lock acquisition with deadlock detection:

- `acquireLock`: For exclusive locks (Mutex)
- `acquireLockRO`: For shared locks (RWMutex)

These methods encapsulate the deadlock detection logic and provide a consistent interface for lock acquisition.

### 2.3 Configuration

The deadlock detection system is configurable:

- `SetDeadlockDetection`: Enables or disables deadlock detection
- `SetLockTimeout`: Sets the timeout for a specific lock
- `GetLockTimeout`: Gets the current timeout for a lock

## 3. Benefits

- **Reduced Contention**: Fine-grained locks allow unrelated operations to proceed in parallel
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Consistent lock ordering prevents circular wait conditions
- **Early Detection**: Timeout-based detection identifies potential deadlocks before they cause system hangs
- **Graceful Degradation**: Operations can fail gracefully when locks cannot be acquired
- **Improved Observability**: Lock acquisition failures are logged with detailed information

## 4. Future Improvements

- Add lock acquisition stack traces for better debugging
- Implement adaptive timeouts based on system load
- Add lock contention metrics for monitoring
- Consider using read-biased locks for high-concurrency scenarios
