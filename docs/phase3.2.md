# Phase 3.2: Syntax Fixes and Missing Components

This phase focuses on fixing syntax issues and implementing missing components for the high-frequency trading platform.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Message Struct in PeerJS Client

Added the missing `Message` struct to the PeerJS client package:
- `internal/peerjs/client.go`

The `Message` struct is essential for handling WebSocket messages in the PeerJS client. It was previously defined in the server package but not in the client package, causing compilation errors.

### 2. Configuration Management

Implemented a comprehensive configuration management system:
- `internal/config/config.go`: Configuration loading, validation, and access
- `config/config.yaml`: Default configuration file

The configuration system uses Viper for flexible configuration loading from files and environment variables. It includes settings for all components of the system, including server, database, WebSocket, PeerJS, market data, risk management, monitoring, and authentication.

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

Added JWT-based authentication and authorization:
- `internal/auth/jwt.go`: JWT token generation and validation
- `internal/auth/middleware.go`: Gin middleware for authentication and role-based authorization
- `internal/auth/jwt_test.go`: Unit tests for JWT functionality

The authentication system provides secure access to the API and WebSocket endpoints. It includes role-based authorization to restrict access to certain endpoints based on user roles.

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. Unit Testing

Added unit tests for the authentication system:
- `internal/auth/jwt_test.go`

This is the first step in implementing comprehensive testing for all components of the system.

### 2. Error Handling

Improved error handling in the authentication and configuration systems:
- Proper error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w`
- Detailed error messages for better debugging
- Consistent error handling patterns

### 3. Documentation

- Added inline documentation for all new components
- Created documentation for Phase 3.2 changes

## Next Steps

1. Implement unit tests for all components
2. Add integration tests for the entire system
3. Implement user management (registration, login, etc.)
4. Enhance security with rate limiting and input validation
5. Implement WebSocket authentication
