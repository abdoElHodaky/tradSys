# Performance Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the trading system's performance characteristics, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities.

## System Overview

The trading system consists of several key components:

1. **Gateway Service**: Entry point for all client requests
2. **Market Data Service**: Provides real-time and historical market data
3. **Order Service**: Handles order placement, modification, and cancellation
4. **Risk Service**: Performs risk checks and enforces trading limits
5. **WebSocket Service**: Provides real-time updates to clients
6. **Matching Engine**: Matches buy and sell orders
7. **Exchange Connectors**: Connects to external exchanges
