# Code Splitting Plan for tradSys Repository

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive 8-phase plan to systematically eliminate type conflicts, compilation errors, and architectural inconsistencies in the tradSys codebase. The plan addresses issues arising from merged feature branches with conflicting type definitions and incomplete module implementations.

## Current Issues Summary

### Fixed Issues ‚úÖ
- Repository type conflicts (OptimizedOrderRepository vs OrderRepository)
- Pool initialization missing size parameters
- Batch processor type mismatches (map vs slice)
- Missing ClientOrderIDs field in OrderService

### Remaining Critical Issues ‚ùå
- Type redeclarations: HealthStatus, DatabaseConfig, Logger, MatchingEngine, etc.
- Missing dependencies in ADX and Islamic finance modules
- Interface conflicts between core_interfaces.go and optimized_interfaces.go
- Generic type instantiation issues in CQRS core
- Unused imports and missing function definitions

## Implementation Plan

2. Document DatabaseConfig conflicts between `pkg/config/config.go` and `pkg/config/optimized_config.go`
3. Map interface conflicts between `pkg/interfaces/core_interfaces.go` and `pkg/interfaces/optimized_interfaces.go`
4. Identify repository type conflicts between standard and optimized versions
5. Create mapping document showing current locations, differences, and usage patterns

**Files Involved:**
- `pkg/common/service_base.go`
- `pkg/common/health_handler.go`
- `pkg/config/config.go`
- `pkg/config/optimized_config.go`
- `pkg/interfaces/core_interfaces.go`

**Tasks:**
1. Create `experimental/` directory for incomplete features
2. Move `services/exchanges/adx_*` files to `experimental/adx/`
3. Create stub implementations or build tags to conditionally exclude incomplete modules
4. Update imports and remove references to undefined types
5. Add TODO comments with implementation requirements

**Files Involved:**
- `services/exchanges/adx_service.go`
- `services/exchanges/adx_connection_manager.go`

## Benefits of This Approach

### üîí Zero Regression Risk
Systematic approach ensures no functionality is lost during refactoring

### üìö Clear Documentation
Each phase creates documentation for future maintenance and onboarding

### üß™ Testable
Each phase can be validated independently before proceeding to the next

### üîÑ Reversible
Changes can be rolled back if issues arise, thanks to clear phase boundaries

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Clarity
Results in clean, maintainable code structure with clear separation of concerns

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Starting Each Phase:
1. Create a backup branch from current state
2. Review the phase objectives and success criteria
3. Ensure all dependencies from previous phases are complete

### During Implementation:
1. Make incremental commits with clear messages
2. Test compilation after each significant change
3. Document any deviations from the plan
4. Update this document if new issues are discovered

### After Completing Each Phase:
1. Validate all success criteria are met
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Update the status in this document
4. Create a summary of changes made

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas:
- **Interface Changes**: May break existing implementations
- **Configuration Merging**: Could affect runtime behavior
- **Generic Type Fixes**: Complex type system interactions

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Use adapter patterns during transition periods
- Extensive testing at each phase boundary
- Clear rollback procedures documented

## Timeline Estimation

- **Phase 1-2**: 1-2 days (Assessment and common types)
- **Phase 3-4**: 2-3 days (Configuration and interfaces)
- **Phase 5-6**: 2-3 days (Module isolation and CQRS)
- **Phase 7-8**: 1-2 days (Cleanup and validation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-10 days

## Success Metrics

1. **Compilation Success**: All packages compile without errors
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: All checks pass consistently
3. **Test Coverage**: No reduction in test coverage
4. **Performance**: No significant performance regressions
5. **Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication and clearer architecture
