# 🏗️ Comprehensive Code Standardization Plan

## 📊 Current Architecture Analysis

### Directory Structure Overview
- **`internal/`**: 44+ packages (correctly used but overly complex)
- **`pkg/`**: 4 packages (under-utilized public API surface)
- **`services/`**: 15 packages (non-standard Go directory)

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Duplicate Type Definitions**: 10+ EngineConfig definitions causing compilation errors
2. **Constructor Function Explosion**: 40+ different NewEngine functions
3. **Package Boundary Confusion**: Similar responsibilities across multiple packages
4. **Complex Switch Statements**: 91 files with switch blocks needing optimization
5. **High-Complexity Conditions**: 10% of if statements have 4+ conditions

## 🎯 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical - 2-4 hours)
**Dependencies**: None
**Parallelism**: Can run independently

#### Tasks:
1. Create `pkg/types/engine_types.go` with canonical definitions
2. Remove duplicate type definitions from internal packages
3. Update all imports to use canonical types

#### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ Eliminates compilation errors
- ✅ Single source of truth for core types
- ✅ Improved memory efficiency

### Phase 2: Factory Pattern (High Impact - 2-3 hours)
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (requires canonical types)
**Parallelism**: Cannot run until Phase 1 complete

#### Tasks:
1. Create `pkg/matching/factory.go` with centralized engine creation
2. Implement EngineType enum and factory function
3. Update all engine instantiation code

#### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ Clear API for engine selection
- ✅ Centralized instantiation logic
- ✅ Type-safe engine selection

### Phase 3: Handler Patterns (Medium Impact - 3-5 hours)
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (requires types)
**Parallelism**: Can run parallel to Phase 2

#### Tasks:
1. Extract compliance rule handlers from switch statements
2. Implement event routing handlers
3. Convert strategy selection switches to dispatcher pattern

#### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ Reduced switch block complexity
- ✅ Easier to test individual handlers
- ✅ Extensible without modifying dispatcher

### Phase 4: Directory Reorganization (Medium Impact - 4-6 hours)
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-3 (requires stable interfaces)
**Parallelism**: Cannot run until previous phases complete

#### Tasks:
1. Move services to appropriate internal/pkg locations
2. Create public interfaces in pkg/
3. Update import paths across codebase

#### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ Clear public/private separation
- ✅ Standard Go directory structure
- ✅ Improved API discoverability

### Phase 5: Condition Optimization (Low-Medium Impact - 2-3 hours per package)
**Dependencies**: Phase 4 (requires stable package structure)
**Parallelism**: Can process multiple packages in parallel

#### Tasks:
1. Extract complex business logic conditions to methods
2. Create descriptive method names
3. Improve code readability

#### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ More readable code
- ✅ Encapsulated business logic
- ✅ Easier to test conditions

## 📋 Quality Assurance Criteria

### Maximum Code Lines Conditions
- **Switch cases**: Max 10 lines per case (extract to methods if longer)
- **If conditions**: Max 3 conditions per statement (extract to methods if more)
- **Functions**: Max 50 lines (split into smaller functions if longer)
- **Files**: Max 500 lines (split into multiple files if longer)

### Consistency Requirements
- **Naming**: Consistent patterns across all packages
- **Error handling**: Standardized error types and messages
- **Logging**: Consistent log levels and formats
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% code coverage

### Durability Standards
- **Backward compatibility**: All public APIs maintain compatibility
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues operating with partial failures
- **Configuration validation**: All configs validated at startup
- **Resource cleanup**: Proper cleanup of all resources
