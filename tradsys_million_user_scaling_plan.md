## Success Metrics

The following metrics will be used to validate the success of the scaling plan:

1. **Request Throughput**: System should handle at least 10,000 requests per second
2. **Response Time**: 95th percentile response time under 200ms for API requests
3. **Error Rate**: Error rate below 0.1% under peak load
4. **Resource Utilization**: CPU and memory utilization below 70% under peak load
5. **Database Performance**: Query response time below 50ms for 95% of queries
6. **Scalability**: Linear scaling with additional instances (2x instances = ~2x capacity)
7. **Recovery Time**: System should recover from component failures within 30 seconds

## Rollback Plan

For each phase, a rollback plan will be prepared to quickly revert changes if issues are detected:

1. Configuration changes will be versioned and previous configurations preserved
2. Code changes will be implemented behind feature flags where possible
3. Database schema changes will include rollback scripts
4. Deployment changes will use blue/green deployment for quick rollback
5. Monitoring will include alerts for degraded performance after changes
