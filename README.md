## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

TradSys is built on a modern microservices architecture with the following core components:

### Core Services

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for external requests, handles routing and authentication
- **Order Service**: Manages order lifecycle, execution, and tracking
- **Market Data Service**: Processes and distributes real-time market data
- **Strategy Service**: Executes trading strategies and generates signals
- **Risk Management Service**: Enforces risk controls and limits
- **Position Service**: Tracks positions and exposures across accounts
- **Authentication Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization
- **Decision Support Service**: Provides analytics and decision-making capabilities

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Separates read and write operations
- **Event Sourcing**: Stores state changes as a sequence of events
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems
- **Bulkhead**: Isolates components to contain failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls resource usage and prevents overload
- **Lazy Loading**: Loads components on-demand to optimize resource usage

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abdoElHodaky/tradSys.git
cd tradSys

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Build the application
go build -o tradsys ./cmd/main.go
```

### Configuration

Create a configuration file `config.yaml` in the root directory:

```yaml
environment: development
server:
  port: 8080
  readTimeout: 5s
  writeTimeout: 10s
  idleTimeout: 120s
database:
  driver: postgres
  host: localhost
  port: 5432
  username: postgres
  password: postgres
  database: tradsys
  sslMode: disable
  maxConns: 10
  maxIdle: 5
messaging:
  provider: nats
  url: nats://localhost:4222

  max_reconnects: 10
  reconnect_wait: 5s
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run the application
./tradsys --config config.yaml
```

## üìä Decision Support System (DSS)

The Decision Support System provides advanced analytics and decision-making capabilities for trading strategies. It integrates with the core trading platform to provide real-time insights and recommendations.

### Integration Patterns

The DSS API supports multiple integration patterns:

1. **Synchronous Request-Response**: For immediate analysis and recommendations
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: For complex, time-consuming operations
3. **Event-Driven Integration**: For real-time updates based on market events
4. **Streaming Data**: Via WebSockets for continuous updates
5. **Batch Processing**: For large datasets and historical analysis

### Key API Endpoints
