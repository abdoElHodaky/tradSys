# Phase 1: Assessment & Proof of Concept

## Overview
This phase focuses on validating the performance assumptions and creating a proof of concept for the Fiber migration.

## Objectives
1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare Gin vs Fiber performance
2. **Compatibility Testing**: Validate fx integration and GORM compatibility
3. **WebSocket Performance**: Test real-time data streaming capabilities
4. **Proof of Concept**: Build minimal trading service with Fiber

## Duration: 2 weeks

## Deliverables
- [ ] Performance benchmark results
- [ ] Fiber PoC implementation
- [ ] Compatibility validation report
- [ ] Migration feasibility assessment

## Current Status: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

### Week 1: Performance Benchmarking
