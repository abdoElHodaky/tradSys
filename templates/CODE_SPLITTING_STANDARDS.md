# 🏗️ **TradSys Code Splitting Standards & Templates**
## **Consistency & Durability Guidelines Based on Orders Service Success**

---

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

This document establishes the official standards for code splitting in TradSys, based on the successful Orders Service pattern. All future splits must follow these templates to ensure consistency, maintainability, and durability.

### **Core Principles**
- **Maximum File Size**: 410 lines per file (strict enforcement)
- **Consistent Naming**: Standardized file naming conventions
- **Architectural Patterns**: Early returns, proper error handling, structured logging
- **Performance Requirements**: Maintain <100μs latency, 100,000+ orders/second

## 🎯 **Standard File Structure Pattern**

### **Required Files for Each Split**
```bash
{system}/{component}/
├── types.go          # Type definitions, constants, enums
├── core.go           # Main struct, constructor, public API
├── processors.go     # Business logic processing
├── validators.go     # Validation logic and rules
├── {specific}.go     # Component-specific files (optional)
└── {component}.go    # Reference file (14 lines max)
```

### **File Size Limits**
```yaml
Strict Limits:
  - types.go: ≤ 300 lines (type definitions)
  - core.go: ≤ 350 lines (main logic)
  - processors.go: ≤ 350 lines (processing logic)
  - validators.go: ≤ 350 lines (validation logic)
  - specific files: ≤ 350 lines each
  - reference file: ≤ 20 lines (documentation only)
```

## 📊 **Success Metrics & Quality Gates**

### **Pre-Split Checklist**
- [ ] File exceeds 410 lines
- [ ] Identify logical separation points
- [ ] Map dependencies between components
- [ ] Plan test coverage for split files
- [ ] Document performance requirements

### **Post-Split Validation**
- [ ] All files under 410 lines
- [ ] No functionality lost
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review completed
